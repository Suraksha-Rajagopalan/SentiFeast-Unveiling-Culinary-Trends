# SentiFeast- Unveiling Culinary Trends With Zomato Data

## Problem Statement:

Zomato is an Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus, and user-reviews of restaurants, and also has food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities. India is quite famous for its diverse multi-cuisine available in a large number of restaurants and hotel resorts, which is reminiscent of unity in diversity. Restaurant business in India is always evolving. More Indians are warming up to the idea of eating restaurant food whether by dining outside or getting food delivered. The growing number of restaurants in every state of India has been a motivation to inspect the data to get some insights, interesting facts, and figures about the Indian food industry in each city. So, this project focuses on analysing the Zomato restaurant data for each city in India.<br>

The Project focuses on Customers and Company, you have to analyze the sentiments of the reviews given by the customer in the data and make some useful conclusions in the form of Visualizations. Also, cluster the Zomato restaurants into different segments. The data is visualized as it becomes easy to analyze data instantly. The analysis also solves some of the business cases that can directly help the customers find the best restaurant in their locality and for the company to grow and work on the fields they are currently lagging in. This could help in clustering the restaurants into segments. Also, the data has valuable information around cuisine and costing, which can be used in cost vs. benefit analysis. Data could be used for sentiment analysis. Also, the metadata of reviewers can be used for identifying the critics in the industry.

## Project Description:

This project focuses on analyzing restaurant reviews using sentiment-based clustering to provide actionable business insights. The primary goal is to classify restaurants based on customer sentiment and identify patterns that can help businesses enhance their services. To achieve this, we employed machine learning clustering techniques such as **K-Means**, **Hierarchical Clustering** and **DBSCAN** while optimizing hyperparameters to improve model performance.  

We started by preprocessing the dataset, which included encoding sentiment labels (**bad, neutral, good**) into numerical values. The data was then aggregated at the restaurant level by computing the average sentiment score for each restaurant. Missing values were handled to ensure data consistency before applying clustering techniques.  

Initially, **K-Means clustering** was applied to group restaurants based on their sentiment scores. However, to determine the optimal number of clusters (**k**), we utilized **Elbow Method and Silhouette Score**, which suggested **k=7** as the best choice. Despite this, K-Means exhibited limitations in handling noise and outliers, as it assumes spherical clusters and can be sensitive to random initialization.  

To address these challenges, we implemented **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**, a more robust clustering algorithm capable of discovering arbitrary-shaped clusters and handling noise effectively. **Hyperparameter tuning** was performed by adjusting `eps` (epsilon), which defines the neighborhood radius, and `min_samples`, which determines the minimum number of points required to form a cluster. The optimal parameters were selected based on the **Silhouette Score and Nearest Neighbor Distance Plot**, ensuring well-separated clusters.  

The results from DBSCAN provided **more meaningful and noise-resistant clustering**, making it the final choice for this project. Visualization techniques, such as **scatter plots and count plots**, were used to illustrate cluster distributions and highlight differences in restaurant sentiment groups. The clusters identified restaurants with predominantly positive, neutral, and negative sentiment, helping business owners focus on improving service quality in areas with poor customer feedback.  

To evaluate business impact, we considered **interpretability and feature importance** using model explainability tools such as **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)**. This provided insights into how sentiment scores influenced clustering and which factors contributed most to restaurant classifications. The business impact was evaluated based on the ability to segment restaurants effectively, identify customer satisfaction trends, and suggest improvements tailored to different clusters.  

Overall, the project demonstrated that **sentiment-based clustering can serve as a powerful tool for restaurant businesses to understand customer opinions, enhance service strategies, and improve customer satisfaction**. Future improvements could involve integrating **NLP-based sentiment analysis models**, incorporating additional features such as **review length, user engagement, and dining preferences**, or leveraging **deep learning models** for more sophisticated sentiment classification. By continuously refining clustering techniques and sentiment analysis approaches, businesses can gain deeper insights into customer behavior and drive better decision-making strategies.
